<td width= "383" valign="middle"><strong><font face="Arial" color="#400080" size="3"><Bold> Here's where the physics of the game started to break down.  Although the fire alarm is going off, no one is showing up like usual to put the fire out. I wonder why? </font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<td width= "383" valign="middle"><strong><font face="Arial" color="#400080" size="3"><Bold> The fire has now spread to the dining room. I forced Syd to another room, because if a Sim tries to fight a fire by themselves, they usually die trying. </font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<td width= "383" valign="middle"><strong><font face="Arial" color="#400080" size="3"><Bold> Finally, the mystery is solved. The fireman started to show up, but stopped on the corner across from the house.  Also, one of the neighbors is standing out there. Unlike a normal Sim, it wouldn't let me click on her to interact with her.  She also wouldn't leave. The physics of the game have started to break down. </font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<td width= "383" valign="middle"><strong><font face="Arial" color="#400080" size="3"><Bold> It starts getting weird.  The neighbor lady has started to act just as if she's in the cage. She's peeing herself and demanding food. </font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr>
