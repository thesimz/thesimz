     I first bought The Sims because it sounded like a neat concept.  A game in which you control people, going about their daily lives, with their families, their jobs, and their friends.  I also was interested to see how the physics of the game worked.  It sounded like an interesting attempt at AI. So, I started playing, creating a family based around my own, named after my own, a husband and wife, with a young son.  But that soon became kind of boring.  I mean, I have that in real life.  It's not that interesting to play in a game.<br><br>
     So I decided to get more adventurous.  I created a gigolo.  He started a career in politics, and started making some lady friends.  He was being fairly successful, and was getting really close to one of the women.   Finally, he proposed to her.  She turned him down.  Now, at this point, I was getting bored of the game again, and had read on the web that someone found out that the Sims could die.  So I turned the opportunity of the rejection to make my character a serial killer.  Chronicled below is what developed.<br><br>

Since one of them was responsible for him cracking, they were the first into the cage. They were given all the luxuries they should need (toilet and food), but apparently if they're trapped, they won't use it. </font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr>

Syd's removed the luxuries, since they were just in the way. One has peed her pants, and they're both rather hungry. </font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr>

He uses a basketball hoop to lure them into the cage, then closes the gate off between the two inner chambers. He's becoming very efficient. </font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr>
